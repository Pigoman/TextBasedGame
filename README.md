# TextBasedGame (Java Files)
Simple text-based game framework and example in Java, for educational use.

This is a simple text-based game framework to be modified by students, allowing them to create their own game.
Objects, threads and a GUI are omitted for simplicity.
The purpose for this project is to teach the Bronxville Tech Club the basics of game design within the scope of the material we have covered.
An example has been created to demonstrate intended conventions and a basic framework has been created to be easily modified.

# C Sharp and XML
Improvement on the text-based game engine, allowing for easy loading/playing of stories rather than hard-coding one story. 
The objective of this program is to gain profficiency in C# and XML while improving upon an earlier idea.
